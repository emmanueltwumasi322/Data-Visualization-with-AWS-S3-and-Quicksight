<h1>Unlocking data insights with AWS Quicksight and S3</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This repository demonstrates an end-to-end  data  visualization workflow  using Amazon S3  and Quicksight. The project focuses on storing structured datasets in S3 and transforming them into interactive dashboards in quicksight to uncover trends, metrics, and insights.<br />


<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

- <b>Amazon S3</b> 
- <b>AWS Management Console</b>
- <b>QuickSight</b>

    
<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b> (21H2)

<h2>Walk-through:</h2>

<b>1. Dataset: </b>
Start by sourcing your data. For example, I downloaded Spotify related datasets on artists from Kaggle. <br />

<b>2. S3 Bucket Setup and Data Uploads: </b>
I created S3 bucket and uploaded dataset files such as "data_by_artist.csv". <br />

<b>3. AWS QuickSight Configuration: </b>
I signed up for AWS QuickSight on a free trial, chose my authentication preferences and granted QuickSight permission to access my S3 bucket for data ingestion. <br />

<b>4. Data Visualization in QuckSight: </b>
I created a new dataset, connected it to the data stored in S3, and began building visualization. I also experimented with different chart types and filters to extract meaningful insights. <br />
